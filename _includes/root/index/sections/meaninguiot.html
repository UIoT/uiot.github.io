                <p>It means being an open source project, focused on creating the <b>very first</b> Internet of
                    Things
                    middleware, platform and architecture capable of delivering software and hardware that
                    serves
                    as many set of devices as possible, and the maximum set of different technologies too.

                <h5>Does it really work?</h5>
                <p>We have been identifying <s>enormous</s> sets of complex problems that resides in our
                    everyday life
                    and
                    therefore, that we need to solve. We're in constant progress, going as far as possible in a
                    daily
                    basis.
                    Providing intelligent systems and aims to make devices and clients
                    real smart objects.

                <p>A real <b>Universal</b> platform is far from
                    existence, but we're the nearest point out here. We're advancing with math, physics,
                    software and
                    electronic engineering. We know it's not going to be
                    an easy-ride, but we strongly believe that someday the IoT will be universal.
